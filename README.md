## The Competition Itself

The Clap Competition is a regular competition that takes place on the Liberty University Commons 1 - Floor 8 menâ€™s hall between two competitors. Each competitor is required to find a coach that will represent and advise them during their competition. Additionally, each competitor can enlist one person to serve as their hypeman, but having one is not a requirement. The job of the hypeman is to cheer on the competitor as much as possible. A competition is conducted by a judge. The judge begins a competition by asking the competitors to identify themselves and who they have selected as their coach. The judge then ensures that all participants are familiar with the rules of engagement. Before the competition begins, the coaches are instructed to inspect the hands of the opponent clapper in order to ensure that no performance-enhancing lotions or other illegal substances are being used. If necessary, the coaches are allowed to use a towel to remove excess moisture.

The competition itself consists of two rounds and an optional third round in the case that the previous rounds are not conclusive. The first and second rounds consist of each competitor clapping one time, while the third round involves two consecutive claps from each competitor. Immediately before the round begins, the judge puts on a blindfold and instructs all the participants and audience members to be silent. The competitors compete in a game of rock paper scissors to determine who gets to choose whether to go first or second in the round. After the winning competitor signifies which order the claps will take place, the coaches facilitate the shuffling of the positions of the competitors so that the judge does not know which competitor is clapping. During the shuffling, the audience members and the participants stomp their feet in order to mask whether the competitors swap positions or not.

Once the competitors are in position, the judge will ask for confirmation from the coaches that the competitors are ready. Then the first competitor will clap, followed by the second clapper. After both claps have been heard, the judge will announce his decision on who won the round. Once the judge has announced his decision, the participants and the audience members are permitted to make noise once more. The first clapper to win two rounds is victorious. After the competition concludes, relevant data is input into the database that stores information on the history of clapping competition matches.

## The Website

The Clap Competition ELO Ranking website is a full-stack web app that displays the information stored in a database. This project was created by designing, implementing, and hosting a web app that displays information about competitors and match history and allows users to add a new match. The app uses SQLite to store all of the relevant data, Flask for directing users to various templates and for executing queries to interact with the database, and Render for hosting the site.<img width="468" height="104" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32daa170-77ee-4700-a2ef-d39959cbf05e" />
